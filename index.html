                <p>I am a programmer with two years experience. So far I have been working mainly with C++, also
                   with Java and C. Currently I am looking for something new.</p>

            <h2>AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow</h2>
            <h3>Department of Applied Mathematics, speciality: Mathematics in Computer Science</h3>
            <h3>10.2011 - 07.2013</h3>
            <p>Master’s degree studies were full of finding shortest paths and spanning trees in graphs,
                best efficiency during doing a task, learning about fastest sorting, minimum coverage, maximum matching and
                (simply saying) solving many other problems that required finding algorithms. Beside this
                I had opportunity to learn something about computational complexity, numerical analysis and basics
                of databases (SQL).</p>

            <h2>AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow</h2>
            <h3>Department of Applied Mathematics, speciality: Applied Mathematics</h3>
            <h3>10.2008 - 07.2011</h3>
            <p>Bachelor’s degree was mainly mathematical analysis and algebra with basics of more advanced mathematics
                such as differential equations, calculus of probability, topology, etc. For me it was also
                learning what exactly programming is, how to use popular algorithms and data
                structures and discovering basics of C and C++.</p>

            <h2>Ericpol Sp. z o.o.</h2>
            <h3>Software Developer (10.2014 - now)</h3>
            <h3>Junior Software Developer (07.2013 - 09.2014)</h3>
            <p>My current job is my first practical meeting with <b>Agile</b>, strictly speaking with <b>Scrum</b>. It means
               working in a team of several people, daily contact with client (which is Ericsson), work in iterations (sprints)
               and other consequences of agile methodology.</p>
            <p>On the other (more technical) side, I work with huge <b>C/C++</b> code and I test it using
               <b>Java</b>. I know <b>Clear Case</b> and <b>Subversion</b> revision control systems, which are used to store
               our code. I use mainly <b>Linux</b> (especially some of its Red Hat distributions) which I know from user side, not from
               admin side.</p>

            <h2>Berrylife s.c.</h2>
            <h3>C++/Qt Programmer (12.2012 - 06.2013)</h3>
            <p>In my first job, still as a student, I was writing multitouch applications for museums, exhibitions, shopping
               malls, etc. They were used in similar way as a websites are but they were working quite different and I was writing
               them using other tools - <b>C++</b> with <b>Qt</b> library. During seven months of work in Berrylife,
               except for smaller projects, I prepared for example application package for Małopolskie Targi Innowacji 2013 in Krakow
               and multitouch application for Polish stand at international exhibition CeBIT 2013 in Hannover.</p>

            <h3>So what I can?</h3>
            <p>Surely, technology which I know best is <b>C++</b>. I have been working with it for two years and before that,
               during my studies, it had been my main programming language to implement algorithms.
               I know <b>C</b> and <b>Java</b> on the medium level, as well. During working in Ericpol I have learned myself
               two revision control systems: <b>SVN</b> and <b>Clear Case</b>. I have also tamed with <b>Linux</b>.</p>
            <p>However, for some time web technologies and writing web pages interests me more than familiar languages.
               Beside <b>HTML/CSS</b> I have learned some basics of <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and <b>jQuery</b>, although learning
               after hours of work turned to be not easy. So I would like to spend more time with it and start to work as a
               professional web developer.</p>

            <p>I like when something is built, when something is created. It is surely connected with my programming passion
               but beside this I am interesting in 'building' in more literal sense - in architecture and urban planning.</p>
            <p>For some time photography more and more interests me, especially photography of cities and buildings.
               <a href="http://www.spacerypokrakowie.pl">Here</a> one can find photoblog I have created recently, where
               I add photos taken in Krakow.</p>
            <p>I like football as well. However, now only from the fan perspective.</p>
